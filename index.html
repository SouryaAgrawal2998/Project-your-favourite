        <p>Amongst all the outdoor games, cricket is my favourite and I love to play this game. It is the most watched sport in India and people have an emotional connect towards it. This sport is played by using a bat and a ball between two teams of 11 members each. Every team has its own set of batsmen, bowlers and fielders.</p>


        <p>
            I like this game because it relaxes my mind. Hitting the ball with the bat, bowling a unplayable ball and taking a brilliant catch in this game gives me immense joy. I often play this game in the evening.My favourite player and role model is Virat Kohli. I want to become a successful
            cricketer in future.</p>
